# notes

## Debugging `ts-unused-exports` with Visual Code

To debug, in **Visual Code**, press `CTRL + SHIFT + B`.

Or make sure you run the following in a terminal:

    npm run watch

Back in **Visual Code**, open a file, add a breakpoint (`F9`).
Open a `.feature` file, put the cursor over a `Scenario:` line and press `F5`.

If you don't know where to put the breakpoint, you can always put it in the first line of the default export of `app.ts`.

Hint: to simplify debugging, you can comment out all the other tests in the file.
In **Visual Code**, a quick way to do this, is to select the tests you want to skip, and press `CTRL + /`.
